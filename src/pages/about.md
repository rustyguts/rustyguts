Welcome to my blog! I'm Brendan, also known as Rusty among my friends. As an infrastructure engineer, I love sharing the things I learn on here.

This blog serves as a repository for my knowledge, and I aim to provide valuable information that can benefit others.

Apart from my work, I have a passion for video processing, streaming, and gaming, which I enjoy on the side.

I hope you find the content here useful, and I'll keep this blog alive indefinitely to continue sharing insights and helpful content.
