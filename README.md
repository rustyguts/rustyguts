### Hey! 👋

My name is Brendan, but my friends know me as Rusty 😄

I value autonomy and dependable teammates. I appreciate people who are open-minded, truthful, and genuine. My goal is to make complicated things simple. I can be demanding at times, but I try to be realistic and flexible. I treasure hard work and passion above all else.

- 🦀 I’m currently working at [Bedrock Ocean Exploration](https://bedrockocean.com/). I help build and scale Mosaic, a cloud-native platform for seafloor data management.
- 🎥 On the side I work on [alcoves](https://github.com/alcoves). It's a sandbox of media management software which I'm passionate about.
- 💻 I’m passionate about cloud infrastructure
- 🐶 [I have a dog](https://imgur.com/4T3UYXY) and her name is Rosie!
